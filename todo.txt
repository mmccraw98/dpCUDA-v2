- add integrators
- add particle factory
- add io (integrators will have things saved too)
- make simulation scripts
- split the cuda kernels into separate files for each purpose
- organize the member function definitions in particle.h/.cu
- make tests
- add a cell list
- try to go back to crtp classes for the particles and integrators
