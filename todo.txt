- add integrators
- add particle factory
- add integrator factory
- test setting member functions to final to save speed
- add io (integrators will have things saved too)
- make simulation scripts
- split the cuda kernels into separate files for each purpose
- organize the member function definitions in particle.h/.cu
- figure out how best to lay out the grid, theread, and block dimensions
- make tests
- add a cell list
- try to go back to crtp classes for the particles and integrators
